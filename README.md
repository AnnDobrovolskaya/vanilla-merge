# VANILLA-MERGE

Vanilla-merge is powerful, interesting and messy polygon-clipping algorithm.
His name represents the main idea - naively merge set of polygons into one edge by edge.
There is little inaccuracy when it comes to operations with floating point. 
That's why vanilla-merge is not based on boolean operations.

## USAGE


## EXAMPLE
There are seven adjoining polygons as input so output will be single merged polygon.

![input](./example_images/input.jpg? "Title") ![output](./example_images/output.jpg? "Title")

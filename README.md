# VANILLA-MERGE

Vanilla-merge is powerful, interesting and messy polygon-clipping algorithm.
His name represents the main idea - naively merge set of polygons into one edge by edge.
There is little inaccuracy when it comes to operations with floating point. 
That's why vanilla-merge is not based on boolean operations.

## USAGE


## EXAMPLE
There are seven adjoining polygons as input so output will be single merged polygon.

<img alt="img.png" height="400" src="./example_images/input.jpg" title="Input" width="350"/> <img alt="img.png" height="400" src="./example_images/output.jpg" title="Output" width="350"/>
